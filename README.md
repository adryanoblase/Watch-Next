# Watch-Next

## Description

This Python script serves as a simple movie recommender system based on natural language processing using the spaCy library.
The script takes a movie description as input and compares it with a list of movies stored in a file (movies.txt). 
It then calculates the similarity between the input description and each movie in the file, ultimately recommending the movie with the highest similarity score.

planet_hulk_description = "Will he save their world or destroy it? When the Hulk becomes too dangerous for the Earth, the Illuminati trick Hulk into a shuttle and launch him into space to a planet where the Hulk can live in peace. Unfortunately, Hulk lands on the planet Sakaar where he is sold into slavery and trained as a gladiator."

recommended_movie = get_watch_next(planet_hulk_description)

if recommended_movie:
    print("Recommended Movie:", recommended_movie)
else:
    print("No matching movies found.")

# Note
Ensure the movies.txt file contains a variety of movie descriptions for better recommendations.
